2. The installation may take minutes to hour depending on your internet speed and hardware. You may check the installation status by viewing the container logs. Run the below command to check the container log:

        docker logs YOUR_CONTAINER_ID

    You should see the line of `=> Setup completed` if you have successfully complete the installation.

### Connect to it from an application

    docker run --link ip2location:ip2location-db -t -i application_using_the_ip2location_data

### Make the query

    psql -h ip2location-db --username=postgres -d ip2location_database

Enter YOUR_POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD password when prompted.

Start lookup by following query:

    SELECT * FROM ip2location_database WHERE ip2int('8.8.8.8') BETWEEN ip_from AND ip_to LIMIT 1;

Notes: For IPv6 lookup, please convert the IPv6 into BigInt programmatically. There is no build-in function available with PostgreSQL.
